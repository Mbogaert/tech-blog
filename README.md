# tech-blog

AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions

WHEN I visit the site for the first time
THEN I am presented with the homepage navigation links for the homepage and the dashboard;
WHEN I click on the homepage option
THEN I am taken to the homepage

WHEN I click on the homepage option in the navigation
THEN I am taken to the homepage and presented with existing blog posts that include the post title and the date created

WHEN I click on one of my existing posts in the dashboard
THEN I am able to delete or update my post and taken back to an updated dashboard

WHEN I am idle on the page for more than a set time
THEN I am automatically signed out of the site 

ADD Style to the site
